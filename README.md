# Data Exploration Practice assignment
 ##Use the dataset contribution.csv 
The data summarizes the contributions received by
a selective private liberal arts college in the US. The college has a large endowment and, as all
private colleges do, keeps detailed records on alumni donations. The data set consists of n =
1230 living alumni and contains their contributions for the years 2000â€“2004. In addition, the
data set includes several other variables such as gender, marital status, college major,
subsequent graduate work, and attendance at fund-raising events, all variables that may play an
important role in assessing the success of future capital campaigns. This is a carefully
constructed and well maintained data set; it contains only alumni who graduated from the
institution, and not former students who spent time at the institution without graduating. The
data set contains no missing observations.

You need to explore data to come up with insights. Treat this case study as open ended and try
to come up with a few insights. Imagine you are responsible for making sure that alumni
contributions and donations by former students keep coming in.

The data dictionary for the data set is as follows:
Gender = Gender of the alumni
Class Year = Year of passing out
Marital Status = Self Explanatory
Major = Subject Majored in
Next degree = Next degree obtained after passing out from the college
FY04Giving = $ Amount given as donation
FY03Giving = $ Amount given as donation
FY02Giving = $ Amount given as donation
FY01Giving = $ Amount given as donation
FY00Giving = $ Amount given as donation
Attendance Event = Was fundraising event attended? (1:Yes, 0:No)
